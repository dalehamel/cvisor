* YAML/JSON format for jq installer
 * jq support in installer
 * Disk layout, network interfaces
 * ntp server, resolvers
* Move packages into a packages file in 'profiles'
* Move ubuntu specific code (where possible) to ubuntu profile
 * cvisor will always need to be ubuntu because of live-boot
* figure out if travis will work (sudo?)
* Better docs
 * Better describe how a config works
* Formalize steps
 * Look to ebuild / pkgbuild for inspiration and hook points
 * Be able to stop at a step / pick up later (useful for packer)
